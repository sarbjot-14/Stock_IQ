## Reflection

### Context
* Wanted to learn react.js and help others and myself learn about the stock market.

### Learning Outcomes
1. Learned basics of react.js and the benifits of using compponents
2. Learned more about stocks and corporations I was not aware of.
3. Learned how to work with api's and transfering data in json format. Learning how to use fetch with api's
4. Learned about asynchronous concepts such as promises, .then, async functions, await keyword
5. Learned about JSX and how javascript can be with inside html.
6. Learned about react hooks such as setState.
### Unexpected Obstacles
* I had to follow youtube tutorials to understand how to use api's, which slowed me down
* Did not realize that the information promised in API may not be complete. which required addtional error handling.
* Had a difficult time organizing data and understanding how data is passed betwwen components.
